# Setting Up Scripts for Password-less or Password-Enabled SSH Connection

This README provides instructions for setting up scripts for establishing SSH connections with password-less or password-enabled authentication. It assumes you have one master and one slave node.

## Prerequisites

- Master and slave nodes accessible over SSH
- Basic knowledge of SSH and shell scripting

## Instructions

1. **Generate SSH Key (Optional)**:

    If you want to set up password-less SSH authentication:
    
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

    Follow the prompts to generate SSH keys. 

2. **Copy SSH Key to Master and Slave**:

    If using password-less SSH, copy the public key to the master and slave nodes:
    
    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id <user>@<master_node>
    ssh-copy-id <user>@<slave_node>
    ```

    Replace `<user>` with your username and `<master_node>` and `<slave_node>` with the IP addresses or hostnames of your master and slave nodes.

3. **Test SSH Connection**:

    Ensure that you can SSH to the master and slave nodes without entering a password:
    
    ```bash
    ssh <user>@<master_node>
    ssh <user>@<slave_node>
    ```

4. **Run Scripts**:

    You can now use the provided scripts for your tasks, ensuring that they establish SSH connections as required. If your scripts need password-less SSH, ensure that they use SSH keys for authentication. If password-enabled SSH is required, ensure that your scripts handle password prompts appropriately.
